Its a real time data available from City Of Toronto - Open Data Portal. My analysis will involve cleaning and processing the data, followed by utilizing Tableau to perform advanced analysis and generate valuable insights.

Right now, I have further studied the data & tried to relate the features & its importance & cleaned them further.
I am working on creating some sheets, that look simple yet conveys the insights easily. looking forward to share my dashboard soon !!
